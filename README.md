-The go server serves the static content from ist an with latest angular-cli, dist doesn't get updated with code changes, for every angular UI part change, we need to run ng build --prod
-There are two places where you need to add your script path, first will be to validate the document and second is optional, to bring up the server via UI.
- For the hash value of document, I am right now using MD5 (it displays different ASCII charecters on the UI), maybe we can use the hash greturned post smart contract execution
-The Admin Console only has one component right now, perhaps wecan put a view of our network over there.
-The document storage path (DocList.json) is hardcoded, you can change the path
